### MINST Digit Classifier Implementation
This repository contains implementations of three models for digit classification using the MNIST dataset.

Implemented Models:
- One-Layer Perceptron
- Softmax Regression (Multi-class Logistic Regression)
- Linear Regression

Each model is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset for digit recognition. The code is organized for clarity and ease of understanding.
